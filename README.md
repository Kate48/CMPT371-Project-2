In the process of implementing a reliable protocol which meets these requirements:

Connection-oriented: handshake 
Reliable and pipelined: sliding window - go back n 
Flow control: adjust rwnd size 
Congestion control: AIMD on cwnd

So far the handshake is implemented, working on sliding window. - Kate (Nov 22 1pm)
